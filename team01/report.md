## 1. Overall Structure of Our Approach
## 2. Code Breakdown
## 3. Experimental Evaluation
To test our code for project 1, we ran a series of 20 tests for each variant. For each test, we recorded whether or not the character successfully reached the goal, and the score of the character when the run terminated. We then averaged these scores to get a sense of how well our code performed. The results of these tests, as well as some brief analysis, are shown below.

For the first ten tests of each variant, we simply ran the base map given to us to define the goals of the project. The following ten tests used a variety of different placements for walls, monsters, and the goal to test the robustness of our code. For each of these tests, they were standardized across all variants (accounting for the differing number and types of monsters). 
### 3.1 Variant 1
### 3.2 Variant 2
### 3.3 Variant 3
### 3.4 Variant 4
### 3.5 Variant 5
