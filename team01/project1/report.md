## 1. Overall Structure of Our Approach
## 2. Code Breakdown
## 3. Experimental Evaluation
To test our code for project 1, we ran a series of 10 tests for each variant, with different seeds for each test. For each test, we recorded whether or not the character successfully reached the goal, and the score of the character when the run terminated. We then averaged these scores to get a sense of how well our code performed. The results of these tests, as well as some brief analysis, are shown below.

### 3.1 Variant 1
### 3.2 Variant 2
### 3.3 Variant 3
### 3.4 Variant 4
### 3.5 Variant 5
