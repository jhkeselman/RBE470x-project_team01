## 1. Overall Structure of Our Approach
Our character control code is contained within a file called `aicharacter.py`.
## 2. Code Breakdown
## 3. Experimental Evaluation
To test our code for project 1, we ran a series of 10 tests for each variant, with different seeds for each test. For each test, we recorded whether or not the character successfully reached the goal, and the score of the character when the run terminated. We then averaged these scores to get a sense of how well our code performed. The results of these tests, as well as some brief analysis, are shown below.

The seeds we used were as follows: 123, 716, 632, 516, 633, 127, 277, 516, 233, 912.
### 3.1 Variant 1
Out of [x] tests, the character successfully reached the goal [y] times. The average score of the character when the run terminated was [z]. This variant should work flawlessly, as it is the simplest of the five variants with no monsters involved.
### 3.2 Variant 2
Out of [x] tests, the character successfully reached the goal [y] times. The average score of the character when the run terminated was [z].
### 3.3 Variant 3
Out of [x] tests, the character successfully reached the goal [y] times. The average score of the character when the run terminated was [z].
### 3.4 Variant 4
Out of [x] tests, the character successfully reached the goal [y] times. The average score of the character when the run terminated was [z].
### 3.5 Variant 5
Out of [x] tests, the character successfully reached the goal [y] times. The average score of the character when the run terminated was [z].
